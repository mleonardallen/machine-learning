    " - Train Time: Because this is a quadratic programming problem, training complexity is O(n^2) or O(n^3) depending on the model parameters.\n",
    " - Test Time: Prediction complexity is proportional number of support vectors. Generally this is O(nSV*d) where nSV is the number of support vectors and d is the dimenionsality or O(1) in terms of n\n",
    " - Space: For SVM we don't need to keep all the data around.  To represent the model we just need the support vectors, making space O(nSV) or O(1) in terms of n\n",
    "- What are the general applications of this model?\n",
    " - SVMs can be used for classification, regression and outliers detection.\n",
    "- What are its strengths and weaknesses?\n",
    " - Strength: Works well in high dimensional feature spaces.  The complexity of trained classifier depends on the number of support vectors rather than the dimensionality of the data.\n",
    " - Strength: Always has a unique solution or global optima.\n",
    " - Weakness: Do not work well with very large datasets since training time tends to be cubic with size of the dataset.\n",
    " - Weakness: Does not work well with noisy data.  Even a small number of mislabeled examples can reduce training time performance.\n",
    "- Given what you know about the data so far, why did you choose this model to apply?\n",
    " - We are working with a fairly small data set, so therefore training time will still be small even with the exponential Big O.  In addition, it is feasible that we would only need to train once, so an expensive training computation might not be a big issue.\n",
    " - The data has a fairly high dimensional feature space, which SVM handles well since features that do not matter will not be a part of the support vectors.\n",
    " - Given we are working with skewed data, SVM may be a good choice because the parameters of an SVM allow adjusting for class weight.\n",
    " - If memory consumption is a large concern in our theoretical environment, the SVM will do well because it only needs to retain the support vectors and not the entire data set during testing.\n",
    " - Testing time is constant with respect to n so we satify the constraint on computation costs."

    "## 5. Choosing the Best Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- Based on the experiments you performed earlier, in 1-2 paragraphs explain to the board of supervisors what single model you chose as the best model. Which model is generally the most appropriate based on the available data, limited resources, cost, and performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Support Vector Machines or SVM is my chosen model based on my experiments.  Models considered include Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and SVM.  Criterion leading to my decision include how the model applies to the given data, limited resources, and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In order to choose the model that best applied to the data, first we must note key properties of the data.  Because we are working with high-dimensional space with relatively few data points to train on, we want to avoid models that will suffer from the curse of dimensionality.  Models such as K-NN would have difficulty finding similarity a high-dimensional space such as this and so were not considered for this problem.  Each of the models considered perform well in high-dimensional spaces.  Another consideration is the skewed nature of the data, with 67.09% of the data set passing.  We might want a model that allows for adjusting the weight of each class.  SVM provides a method for this within the models parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Next, we will look at resource consumption in terms of training time, testing time, and computer memory allocation.  Each contribute to cost, however some may contribute more significantly.  For example it is feasible to believe that we will be training once or infrequently compared to testing.  Because of this more importance is placed on a small testing time.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Of the considered models, SVM does have a disadvantage in terms of training time given a Big-O that is exponential in terms of the number of students we train the model on.  However, given we are training on a small data set, the cost due to training is not largely impacted.  For testing time, SVM is constant with respect to the number of students we train the model on.  This is true for all models chosen for consideration.  In contrast to lazy learners which have to consider the entire data set when testing.  With a small data set, this might not be an issue, but as time goes on the data set will get larger and larger increasing testing time.  For this scenario, the constant testing time given by SVM is favorable.  For memory, each model considered does well here.  In contrast to lazy learners, we only need to store the learned parameters of the model instead of keeping around the entire data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Finally we will look at performance in terms of F<sub>1</sub> Score which encompasses accuracy, recall, and precision.  With untrained models Naive Bayes performs similarly to SVM, however we are unable to adjust the parameters of the Naive Bayes model.  With tuning the SVM is able to get better permanence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In 1-2 paragraphs explain to the board of supervisors in layman's terms how the final model chosen is supposed to work (for example if you chose a Decision Tree or Support Vector Machine, how does it make a prediction).\n",
    "\n",
    "> To understand what SVMs do, first consider a simplified version.  Picture an graph with x, y coordinates.  Within the graph we have some data points of two difference classes.  The job of the SVM is to draw a line separating those two classes so that on one side of the line we have one class and on the other side we have the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The line that SVM chooses to separate the two classes will be the line that creates the most margin between the line and each class subject to constraints.  For example the data may be messy in that some data points from one class might end up on the wrong side of the line, but it is still the line that minimizes how much we get wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Now instead of x, y coordinates, which is a 2-dimensional space, consider that each feature of the student (Internet Access, Free Time, etc) is a dimension.  In a more generalized version SVM is able to create a separating “line” in this higher dimensional space that separates the passing students from the failing students.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fine-tune the model. Use Gridsearch with at least one important parameter tuned and with at least 3 settings. Use the entire training set for this.\n",
